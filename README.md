# ha-sleep-mqtt
This custom integration brings advanced sleep tracking analytics from the SleepAsAndroid app directly into Home Assistant via MQTT. Unlike the standard integration, this version calculates live statistics such as sleep phases, efficiency, and specific sound events (snoring, talking, etc.) in real-time as you sleep.

This custom integration brings advanced sleep tracking analytics from the **SleepAsAndroid** app directly into Home Assistant via MQTT. It features live statistics calculation, a **Real-time Hypnogram**, and full support for Long-Term Statistics.

## 📊 Visualisation Examples

### Sleep Analytics Dashboard
The integration provides a comprehensive set of sensors to monitor your rest. Below is an example of how the sensors and the sleep distribution look in a Home Assistant dashboard.

## ✨ Features

* **📊 Live Hypnogram (Numerical):** `Sleep Phase` sensor using integers (0-3) for instant compatibility with **ApexCharts**.
* **💤 Fell Asleep Tracking:** Records the exact timestamp when you actually transition from "Awake" into sleep.
* **🔄 Precise Calculations:** Real-time sleep duration and phase percentages using decimal values for accurate graphing.
* **📈 Long-term Statistics:** Full support for HA Long-Term Statistics (LTS) with `measurement` state classes.
* **🔊 Sound Event Counters:** Tracks snoring, talking, coughing, laughing, and yawning.
* **⏰ Smart Start & Pause:** Correctly handles "Delayed Start" and "Paused" states to ensure your tracking starts the moment you hit the bed.
* **🌍 Official Translations:** Native support for English and Dutch via Home Assistant translation files.

## 🚀 Installation

### Step 1: Via HACS (Recommended)
1. Open **HACS** > Click the three dots (top right) > **Custom repositories**.
2. Paste: `https://github.com/Roeli1996/ha-sleep-mqtt`
3. Select **Integration** as the category and click **Add**.
4. Search for **SleepAsAndroid MQTT Custom** and download.
5. **Restart** Home Assistant.

### Step 2: Configure SleepAsAndroid App
1. Open the app on your Android device.
2. Go to **Settings > Services > MQTT**.
3. **Enable MQTT** and set your Host/IP (your Home Assistant MQTT broker).
4. **Topic prefix:** e.g., `SleepAsAndroid/Arne`.
5. **Important:** Ensure **Events** is checked in the MQTT settings to enable real-time updates.

## 💡 Dashboard Tip: Donut Chart
To recreate the donut chart shown above, install **ApexCharts** via HACS and use this configuration (replace `arne` with your device name):

```yaml
type: custom:apexcharts-card
header:
  show: true
  title: Sleep Distribution
  show_states: true
  colorize_states: true
chart_type: donut
series:
  - entity: sensor.arne_sleep_deep_sleep
    name: Deep
    color: "#1A237E"
  - entity: sensor.arne_sleep_rem_sleep
    name: REM
    color: "#4FC3F7"
  - entity: sensor.arne_sleep_light_sleep
    name: Light
    color: "#90CAF9"
  - entity: sensor.arne_sleep_awake
    name: Awake
    color: "#FFAB91"
```
